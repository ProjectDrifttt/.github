Emily Bedoy:
My name is Emily, but I go by Kai, and I am a Sato senior in the engineering pathway. I plan to go to college to major in engineering and become a design engineer or an engineering teacher for high schoolers. My love for engineering has only grown with every class and project I take on. I enjoy being able to see my brainstorming ideas come to life and work how I intended them to.  

Jacquline Connell:
Hello! My name is Jacquline. I am currently a senior at Sato in the engineering pathway. My plan for the future is to go to college and major in mechanical engineering. My passion for engineering started in first grade when participating in the school science fair and continued into middle school by joining the school robotics team. 

Connor De Leo:
I am currently a senior at Sato  in the engineering pathway. I am currently taking Engineering Design and Development, and Rocket Engineering Design and Development as my engineering capstone classes. I plan to get a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I gained a passion for engineering while working on small projects with my dad.

## Problem Statement
Amateur and professional drifters do not have a way to score themselves while practicing on practice tracks and there is no sound way to get a properly unbiased score while competing at competitions. Although there is no census for the exact number of people who participate in drift events, drifting is the fastest growing motorsport in the world, with hundreds if not thousands of drift events worldwide. In 2013 alone, there was an increase from 10 to over 30 major drifting series and the number of spectators in Formula Drift has doubled.
